Interactive Math Cube: 3D LED Fractal Visualizer

A dynamic 8x8x8 LED cube powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, bringing Julia and Mandelbrot fractals to life with real-time sound-reactive lighting patterns. This project combines mathematics, hardware design, and programming to create a visually stunning and interactive experience.

Features
	•	Fractal Visualizations: Displays Julia and Mandelbrot sets in 3D using Python-based algorithms.
	•	Sound-Reactive Lighting: Integrates a sound sensor to dynamically adjust lighting patterns based on audio input.
	•	Brightness Modulation: Uses Taylor series to enhance brightness control for smooth, dynamic visuals.
	•	Custom Circuit Design: Built with KiCad, featuring transistor-based cathode control and multiplexing for efficient power management.
	•	Hand-Soldered Assembly: Carefully soldered 512 LEDs into an 8x8x8 cube.

Components Used

Hardware
	•	Raspberry Pi Pico
	•	512 5mm LEDs
	•	Sound Sensor Module
	•	Transistors for cathode control
	•	Resistors and Capacitors for stability
	•	Custom PCB designed in KiCad

Software
	•	Python for fractal generation and lighting control
	•	KiCad for circuit design
	•	MicroPython for embedded programming

How It Works
	1.	Fractal Generation:
	•	Implements recursive algorithms for Julia and Mandelbrot sets using complex numbers.
	2.	Sound Integration:
	•	Captures audio input from the sound sensor and normalizes it to create reactive light patterns.
	3.	Brightness Modulation:
	•	Uses a Taylor series expansion to achieve smooth LED brightness transitions.
	4.	Control Circuitry:
	•	Multiplexing enables efficient control of 128 connections (64 anodes + 64 cathodes).
